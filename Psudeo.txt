Tailea Nguyen - 10/18/17 Period 2

Creating a set of instructions for a card game, specifically as possible

Go fish

Rules
Each person gets 5 cards, regardless of amount of players
Leave the rest of the cards in a stack in the middle
Don't look at someone elses cards and don't lie
The goal of the game is to get the most sets of each card rank

Instructions
The person to the left of the dealer goes first
They look at their cards and check to see what rank they want to ask for
They'll ask a specific person if they have the card.
If that person has the card, they'll give it to the person that asked and then asks the same or another person for another
If the person doesn't have the card asked for they'll say "go fish"
When they say that, the person who asked has to grab a card from the deck
Then the person to their left asks next
It continues like that until all sets of cards are made
Whoever had the most amount of cards, wins
